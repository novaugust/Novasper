# Novasper

This is a customization of the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), [Casper](http://github.com/tryghost/casper/)).

**To download** visit the [releases](https://github.com/novaugust/novasper/releases) page.


## Features

- **Post Description**: post `meta_description` is used as the post excerpt description text, rather than the first x words of the post
- **Post Image**: On any page with post excerpts (home page, archive page, author page, tag page, etc), the post's image is displayed as a full-width background image behind the post excerpt.
- **Full width images**: images within posts are displayed at full browser width
- **Post excerpt hover effect**: There's a cute animation when you hover over post titles, stolen from Tympanus. That's all.
